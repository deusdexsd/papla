## Build products live OUTSIDE this directory, for the same reason the .app does.

## ~/Desktop is iCloud/file-provider synced, and the provider mutates files inside
## .build while the compiler is using them — producing "input file was modified during
## the build" on random object files, and occasionally a wedged swift-frontend stuck at
## 0% CPU. Moving the scratch path to ~/Library/Caches (never synced) removes the race.

## The bundle is assembled and signed OUTSIDE this directory on purpose.
##
## This tree lives under ~/Desktop, which is iCloud/file-provider synced. The provider
## stamps com.apple.FinderInfo onto files inside an .app faster than we can strip them,
## and codesign hard-refuses anything carrying them ("resource fork, Finder information,
## or similar detritus not allowed"). `xattr -cr` immediately before signing is not enough
## — the provider re-stamps in between. Staging in ~/Library/Caches sidesteps it entirely.

## TCC keys the Accessibility grant to the code signature, so an ad-hoc signature — which

## stable Developer ID keeps the identity constant and the grant sticky. Falls back to
## ad-hoc ("-") on a machine without the cert.
